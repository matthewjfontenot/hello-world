Hello World!

My name is Matthew Fontenot. I was born and raised in the heart of Cajun Country, Lafayette, Louisiana. I attended the University of Louisiana and graduated in Petroleum Engineering in May 2017. I have worked in the oil and gas industry for over 2 years and would like to switch careers to become an entry-level software developer. I have taken an online class through edx.org hosted by MITx called Introduction to Computer Science using Python Programming and have received a certificate of completion through this course. I am further developing my skills with Harvard's CS50 course online. I am interested in learning to develop personal projects and to add value to a talented team of developers.
