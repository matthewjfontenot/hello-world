Hello World!

My name is Matthew Fontenot. I was born and raised in the heart of Cajun Country, Lafayette, Louisiana. I attended the University of Louisiana and graduated in Petroleum Engineering in May 2017. I have worked in the oil and gas industry for over a year and would like to switch careers to computer science. I have taken an online class through edx.org hosted by MITx called Introduction to Computer Science using Python Programming and have received a certificate of completion through this course. I hope to begin my computer science career within the next couple months.
