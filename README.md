#About me

Hello World!

My name is Matthew Fontenot. I was born and raised in the heart of Cajun Country in Lafayette, Louisiana. I attended the University of Louisiana and graduated in Engineering in May 2017. I am a motivated self learner who has taken online courses from MIT, Harvard, and Stanford. I have also done multiple tutorials and started on a personal project. In my spare time I like to enjoy the great outdoors, run long distance, and play with my retired racing greyhound, Mack Attack!
